# Time Series
Time series analysis may be divided into two classes: 
        
    1.	frequency-domain methods 
    2.	time-domain methods

Time series analysis techniques may be divided into 

    1.	parametric and
    2.	non-parametric methods. 

   _The parametric approaches assume that the underlying stationary stochastic process has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an autoregressive or moving average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process._ 

   _By contrast, non-parametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure._

Methods of time series analysis may also be divided into 
            
              linear and non-linear, and univariate and multivariate.
